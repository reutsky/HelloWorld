Hi everyone,

My name is Andrew. I'm a graphic and web designer from Siberia currently residing in Canada. I'm looking closely at the artificial intelligence progress and wonder if robots will take the world over. I love new tech, and it fascinates me how fast technologies are evolving!

Regards,
Andrew
